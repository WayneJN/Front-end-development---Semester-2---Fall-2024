Promises:
    I will take an extra session on Friday: Promise!
    Promise fulfilled: I take the session
    Promise not fulfilled: I don't take the session

    Promises in JS are also same:
        i)resolve - fulfilled
        ii)reject - not fulfilled..
    How to write promises in JS?





Fetch API: uses promises!
 A default api for asynchronous communication. It returns a promise rather then normal values...
