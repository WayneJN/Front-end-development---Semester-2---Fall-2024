OOP: Object Oriented Programming...
    Where we consider everything as an OBJECT and do programming around it...
    Object will have -i) Data ... ii) Functions(Code) [code and data]
    
    "class" is a combination of code and data!
    classes are not usable, rather we create "Objects" to work on classes...

    Object is an instantiation of a class...usable form...

In Classical javascript there was no concept of class!but there were few methods to make object (without classes...)

"constructor" function:

Prototypal Inheritance- The real OOP begins...
create a constructor function and place all unused items in the prototype to save teh space while createing new objects...

class:
In recent years (ES5 ES6), a new syntax has been added to JS to allow more familiar with traditional OOP style progreamming to define theri objects using a new "class" keyword.
